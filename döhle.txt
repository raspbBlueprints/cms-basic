for general evaluation of the provided QS feedback.

Specifically for this:
This is indeed an UX improvement. But it is something which has not been requested in the first place. It may be achieved easily, but it is a new demand.

MYD-796 - Desktop view- Inconsistencies present on the NPDI List elements and filters.
Concept flaws now get visible. Who's fault? + WON'T DO [1] [3]

MYD-797 - Apply/Reset Filter functionality does not work
General Filter Shortcomings, needs rework BUT has not been well prepared (concept + backend) open questions have not been answerd...

MYD-798 - Total Results Count Not Displayed Correctly
Relates to filter issues

MYD-800 - The NPDI page does not auto-scroll into view on clicking on the bottom records or applying filters.
Has not been concepted! Feature request.

MYD-801 - “Write a Message” Opens Mailbox Instead of Modal
Has not been concepted! Feature request.

MYD-802 - Mobile view- Inconsistencies present on the NPDI List view screen.
Mostly WON'T DO [1] some are valid = mobile filter modal

MYD-803 - Pagination Arrows Display Incorrectly and Trigger Infinite Loading on First/Last Page
Has not been specified / concpted in the first place we developed this feature from remaining budget. One finding is valid: Disable click event on disabled prev next arrow.

MYD-804 - Unconfirmed Filter Selections Persist After Closing Without Applying
Relates to filter issue - has not been clearly concepted.

MYD-805 - Mobile- Filter and Product Win Should Open as Full-Screen Modals on Mobile
Relates to filter issue (mobile filter as modal is a valid point)

MYD-806 - The Print, Share, and Delete icon/functionalities are not present.
UI  has been prepared (but is hidden), action/functionality hase never been concpeted. Questions remained unanswerd. Delete could possibly b e enabled if there is a proper delete function as part of the backend service!?

MYD-808 - Mobile view- UI Inconsistencies present on the NPDI Product Win.
Relates to 802 / mobile view - Mostly WON'T DO [1] some spaces could be reviewed and corrected.

MYD-810 - Tablet view- UI Inconsistencies present on the NPDI Product Win.
WON'T DO [1] 

MYD-811 - Tablet- Product Win Should Open as Full-Screen Modals
Valid, but needs layout adjustments (no product win visible by default, just after click in modal dialogue)

MYD-820 - Customer Recepies Links Do Not Redirect User
WON'T DO [4] 

MYD-821 - Contact Module Shows Incorrect or Incomplete User Details with Static Pronoun
has not been concepted. How to determine gender? WON'T DO [4] 


1 = inconsistency in design system (every feature reinvents common ui elements => we stick to the library!)
2 = Missing text, images, details due to poorly maintained data, not a UI shortcoming...
3 = Concept Shortcomings: edge cases, open questions
4 = Backend data shortcomings: value / variable not availabe in response.

- Finale Klarheit
